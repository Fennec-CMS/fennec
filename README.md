# Fennec CMS Base

Fennec is a free, open source and highly customizable Content Management System. Different of other systems, it comes only with the mandatory functions, and all other modules (like Blog, Galleries, Users, Newsletter, etc) are installed by the user through a user-friendly interface.

The proposal here is to have an modern, fast, customizable base system to deploy any type of dynamic website.

For now, the first test version is in development and it's not usable at all. However, if you want to support the project, don't be shy, [let me know](dave@blogdodave.com.br) ;)
